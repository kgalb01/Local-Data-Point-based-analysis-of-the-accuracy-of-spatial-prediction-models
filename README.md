# Local-Data-Point-based-analysis-of-the-accuracy-of-spatial-prediction-models-
This work aims to evaluate the accuracy of spatial prediction models using the "Local Data Point Density" (H. Meyer, F. Schumacher, 2024) and therefore proving the functionality of the "LPD" and it's advantages as a extension of the "Disimilarity Index" (H. Meyer, E. Pebesma, 2021).
